# Scanning

## Introduction

The first step in writing a compiler is to write a scanner. A scanner is a program that
reads the source code and breaks it into tokens. A token is a sequence of characters
that have some meaning and make up the language's grammer.

## Chapter overview

By the end of this chapter, we will have a scanner that can take a string of Lox source
code as input and produce a list of tokens as output. We will also start building the
CLI for our Lox interpreter.
